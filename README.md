# latin-translator

A latin translator based on the result of this tutorial: https://medium.com/@kellylougheed/coding-for-classicists-make-your-own-whitakers-words-34a933d289db

It has improved translation capabilities -- this can translate some of the words that the tutorial version couldn't translate. Also, this version includes the ability to translate when the user hits the enter key, not just the submit button.
